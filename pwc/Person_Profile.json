		"Tony Sakich\n\n\n\nJoey is one of the most impressive people I've ever had the pleasure to work with and really gets all aspects of business more than anyone I have ever met. As a developer, Joey is absolutely top notch but his maturity and personality make him an absolute breeze to work with. I've met people with decades of experience that lack the maturity, drive and quality of work that Joey does every single day, there is no person I would recommend higher to anyone else than him and he enhances any team that is lucky enough to have him."
