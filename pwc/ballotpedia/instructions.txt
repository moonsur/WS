1.  install selenium

2.  download chrome driver for selenium and put it in the following path ("C:\data\chromedriver\")
    https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
    you have to download that version which is installed in your PC 
3.  update the path to compatible with your operating system at 
    main.py -> line 27 (chrome_driver_path = 'C:\\data\\chromedriver\\chromedriver.exe') 
    functions.py -> line 18 (chrome_driver_path = 'C:\\data\\chromedriver\\chromedriver.exe')
    config.py -> line 5 (db_config_file_path = db_config_file_dir + '\\db.ini')
